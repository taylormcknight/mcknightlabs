<p>At work this morning, I came across a story about a <a href="http://www.danielstein.org/cv.html">highly successful professional</a> who recommends living a life devoid of goals. This is a pretty unconventional view, and the polar opposite of my own, so it immediately grabbed my attention.</p>

<p>Here's the story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I was a theater major in college. And I had to do this assignment where we would call somebody who was early-career, somebody who was mid-career, and somebody who was late-career. And we were supposed to ask them about their goals – how they were achieving their goals or if they had achieved their goals.</p>
<p>And I called Daniel Stein, who is a director in California, and I asked him about his goals. And he laughed at me.</p>
<p> He said, 'I've never had any goals. I don't plan to have any goals. And you shouldn't either. When you set a goal, you have a limited target. And if something gets in your way, you can't get around an obstacle, you miss the goal, and that's it. Right? You either succeed or you fail. And if you do manage to succeed and achieve your goals, it's not clear what you should do next, because you've already achieved the thing.'</p>
<p>So what he was proposing is that, instead, you should have a vision, a mission, a way of deciding, a system, for deciding how you move through the world, what sort of choices you want to make. And then, any time you run into an obstacle, you just use your system to help you find a way around. And it's not about where you're going to end up, you know how you're going to move."</p>
