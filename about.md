<p>Over the last 10 years, I've led design at Industry Dive, a bootstrapped business media company.<p> 

<p>I helped scale the company from year one through its $500M exit in Sept 2022.</p>

<p>I've built and led a variety of creative and technical teams: product design, brand marketing, content marketing design, news data and graphics, and front-end development.</p>

<h2>My story</h2>

<p>While studying the impact of the internet on society at the London School of Economics, I was inspired to jump from the social sciences to the startup world. After completing my MSc in Global Politics, I joined <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/">Industry Dive</a>, an 11-month-old business media company, as <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/startup/2018-02-05-startupjob.md %}"> employee #5</a> and taught myself the fundamentals of design and front-end development.</p>

<p>From 2012 to the present, I built out a twenty-two member multidisciplinary and global <a href="https://industrydive.design/">design team</a>, helping scale the company to 12M+ readers, $100M+ in revenue and 400+ full-time employees.</p>

<p>Over my last 10 years at Industry Dive, I started and led the following areas of design and multi-media: UX design, UI design, front-end design/development, editorial graphics, photo journalism and graphic design. I also co-led product management with C-suite for the first 5-6 years.</p>
