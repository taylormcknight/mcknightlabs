title: Pizza with a Nobel Prize winner
description: At a recent NASA hackathon, I had the chance to share a pizza lunch with one of the lead scientists on the James Webb Space Telescope project – Dr. John Mather. Mather walked me and about twenty-five other hackathon participants through his career and the history of the JWST project, from the initial committee meetings to the expected launch in 2018.

At a recent <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/">NASA hackathon</a>, I had the chance to share a pizza lunch with one of the lead scientists on the James Webb Space Telescope project – <a href="http://jwst.nasa.gov/meet-mather.html">Dr. John Mather</a>.

Mather walked me and about twenty-five other hackathon participants through his career and the history of the JWST project, from the initial committee meetings to the expected launch in 2018.

The telescope is being built in a cleanroom over at Goddard Space Center. It's pretty cool to know that a piece of scientific equipment that could revolutionize our understanding of the universe is just a 25 minute drive from my apartment.

Here's some background about the project:

**Mission Goals:**

<ul>
	<li>Search for the first galaxies or luminous objects formed after the Big Bang</li>
	<li>Determine how galaxies evolved from their formation until now</li>
	<li>Observe the formation of stars from the first stages to the formation of planetary systems</li>
	<li>Measure the physical and chemical properties of planetary systems, including our own Solar System, and investigate the potential for life in those systems</li>
</ul>

Beyond exploring the evolution of the universe, the telescope will be used to help scientists better understand the formation of our own solar system and more closely study exoplanets.

**Mission length:** 

5-10 years

**Capabilities:** 

The JWST will be able to observe stars 10-100x fainter than its predecessor could detect. Unlike Hubble, which focuses mostly on the visible part of the spectrum,  the JWST will primarily take images in infrared. As objects move away from us, their light waves get stretched and shifted to the red end of the spectrum. Because the universe is expanding in all directions everywhere, the most distant objects – e.g. earliest stars – are all highly "redshifted." If we want to see deeper into space and time, we need to look in infrared.

**Optics:** 

Divided into 18 hexagonal units, the 705kg primary mirror will unfold itself in space. The mirror is made of beryllium, a rare element that can withstand the cold of space, under 50K (-370 °F), much better than glass.

**Communications:** 

The JWST will send and receive data via a high frequency radio transmitter.

**Launch:** 

In October 2018, the JWST will ride to space atop a European <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5">Ariane 5 rocket</a> from French Guiana.
